		<h1>The Water Problem in Cape Town</h1>
		
		<p>By 2019, 4 million people may have to stand in line under the watch of armed guards to receive
		 the world's most valuable resource; water.</p>
		 
		<p>A three-year drought has caused the unimaginable to be reality for the people of Cape Town. 
		Right now, Cape Town's residents are forced to use less than 50 liters of water each day, 
		which is less than one-sixth of what the average American uses. As soon as 2019, 
		they may be forced to use only 25 liters. The day that the city must shut off its taps is known
		as Day Zero. One must wonder how Cape Town, one of the region's most affluent cities, is going 
		through such a water crisis. Surprisingly, signs of Cape Town's water crisis have been 
		around for much longer than it may seem.</p>
		
		<p>In the last 20 years, the city has recognized some of the increased threat of the water-shortage.
		 In fact, the city worked incredibly hard to reduce its water consumption. As a result of their 
		 efforts, Cape Town won several international water management awards. In 2014, the six city dams 
		 were full when the unlikely became reality; the city went through a three year drought. Now, the 
		 reservoirs are standing at 26 percent capacity, and the city is certainly feeling the affects of 
		 this water shortage.</p>
		
		<h1>What We Are Doing To Help</h1>
		
		<p>To help alleviate this massive issue, the Project Well organization is raising $4,500 to build 
		and rebuild two wells in two of Cape Town's schools. Our mission is to provide students like 
		ourselves the water that they need. To learn more about what we are doing to raise this money 
		and where it will go, <a href="how.html">click here</a>. </p>
